# Analysis of CC mouse data

from Srivastava et al. (2017)
<https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.116.198838>

- data available at [zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.377036)

The funnel information for 55 of the 69 strains is in
[Table S2 at the journal
website](http://www.genetics.org/highwire/filestream/438137/field_highwire_adjunct_files/10/TableS2.xlsx).

We used the information in Table S2 and inserted arbitrary cross
direction information for the lines where the funnel codes are not
available.
